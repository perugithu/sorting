Algorithm: Malicious URL Detection and Reporting

Input:
    - CSV file containing URLs ('URL') and labels ('LABEL') indicating whether good or bad
    
Output:
    - Email notification if a malicious URL is detected with positive scan results from VirusTotal API

Begin:
1. Import necessary modules:
    - from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    - from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
    - from sklearn.svm import SVC
    - from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
    - import requests  # for querying VirusTotal API
    - import smtplib  # for sending email notifications

2. Load and Preprocess Data:
    - Load the CSV file into a DataFrame (df)
    - Label the columns as 'URL' and 'LABEL'

3. Text Vectorization:
    - Create a TfidfVectorizer instance to convert text to tokens
    - Tokenize and transform the 'URL' column to feature vectors (X)

4. Train-Test Split:
    - Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split
    - X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=30)

5. Model Training (Support Vector Machine):
    - Create an instance of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with a linear kernel
    - svm_model = SVC(kernel='linear', C=1.0, random_state=30)
    - Train the model using X_train and y_train

6. Model Evaluation:
    - Predict the labels for the test set: y_pred = svm_model.predict(X_test)
    - Calculate the accuracy of the model: accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

7. Malicious URL Detection and Reporting:
    for each URL in the CSV file:
        - Extract features from the URL using the TfidfVectorizer
        - Use the SVM model to predict if it's malicious: is_malicious = svm_model.predict(features)
        - if is_malicious:
            - Query VirusTotal API for scan results: results = query_virustotal_api(URL)
            - if positive results:
                - Send an email notification: send_email_notification(URL, results)

End.
